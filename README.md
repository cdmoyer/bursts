#Bursts
*A simple iOs game writte in lua with the [Corona SDK](http://www.coronalabs.com/)*

## The Game
* Bubbles appear.
* Tap them.
* They pop.
* If there are ten, you lose.
* You get ten points per bubble.
* They appear faster and faster.

## The Code
This code is a mess.  It's the result of a night messing with the Corona SDK and trying to build something.  

The sounds came from googling free pop sounds, and downloading some that said they were public domain.

Feel free to do whatever with this code.  If you happen to bundle it and sell it on an App Store, at least attribute the original code to "Chris Moyer - http://inarow.net"
